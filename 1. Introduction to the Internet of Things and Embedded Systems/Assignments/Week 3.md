### Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  

ATmega32 - RenesasRX
* Clock frequency: 1 MIPS - 240MHz
* Bitwidth of the datapath: 8-bit - 32-bit
* Size of Flash memory: 32KB - 512KB
* Number of pins: 44 - 64
* Analog-to-Digital Converter: 10-bit ADC - 12-bit ADC

8051 Microcontroller :
(https://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=Datasheet 8051&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-_j1BRDkARIsAJcfmTFh...)
clock frequency--24 mhz
Bitwidth of the datapath-- 8 bit
Size of Flash memory--128 byte
Number of pins-- 40
It does not have an Analog to Digital coverter 
  Atmega328 microcontroller:
(https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/392243/ATMEL/ATMEGA328.html)   
clock frequency--20 mhz
Bitwidth of the data path-- 8 bit
size of Flash memory--32k byte
 number of pins--32
It has ADC with 8 bits of precision.

Arduino has no operating system. It can only run programs that were compiled for the Arduino platform, which mostly means programs written in C++. Raspberry Pi runs an operating system, which is usually Linux. It's a mini computer, while Arduino is much more simple. 
operating system of Raspberry pi is Rsapbian .it operates in the open source and runs a suite of open source software .
